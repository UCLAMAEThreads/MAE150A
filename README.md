# MAE150A

This repository is designed for MAE 150A Intermediate Fluid Mechanics at UCLA.

To get started with this package in a jupyter environment, please do the following:

1. Open a terminal from jupyter.

2. In the terminal, navigate to the directory in which jupyter is based. For example, on jupyter.idre.ucla.edu, you would type "cd work" to move to the "work" directory.

3. Type "git clone https://github.com/jdeldre/MAE150A.git". This will create a new directory called "MAE150A"

4. Now, type "cd MAE150A" to change to that directory.

5. Type "./initialize" on the command line. This might take a little while to run, since it downloads and precompiles some package dependencies.

6. Go back to the jupyter window. You should now see "MAE150A" as a directory. (If not, something went wrong...) Go to that directory in jupyter, and start up any of the notebooks. You might want to start with "Index.ipynb", which acts as a list for the others.
