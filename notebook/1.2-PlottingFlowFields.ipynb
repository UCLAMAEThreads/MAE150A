The velocity field is steady and *unidirectional*: it only moves in one direction (the $x$ direction, parallel to the walls). The velocity field has only one component, in the $x$ direction, and varies only with distance from the lower wall $y = 0$. \n",

This ensures that the plot can be understood more universally, rather than specific to just one wall speed and one gap height.\n",

    "In Julia, one useful idea is to define a function with *keyword arguments* that take default values if we omit them. Here, we will use this to define the velocity function so that it can behave either dimensionally (by setting $U$ and $H$ explicity) or nondimensionally (by not setting them, so that $U$ and $H$ each default to 1). By doing the latter, then '$y$' actually represents $y/H$ and '$u$' represents $u/U$."
