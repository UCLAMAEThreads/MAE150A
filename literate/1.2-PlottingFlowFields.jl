# Plotting a steady flow field
In this notebook we will discuss ways that we plot a flow field. We will first
discuss velocity profiles. Then, we will inspect the pre-computed steady flow past
an airfoil again.

### Velocity profiles
One of the most basic ways that we plot a flow field is by plotting a **velocity profile**.
This gives us a means of seeing how the flow speed varies with position.
=#

#=
As an example, let us consider the most basic of flowfields: the steady Couette flow.
This is the flow generated between two parallel walls, when one of the walls is in motion
and the other one is at rest. The velocity field is steady and *unidirectional*: it only moves
in one direction (the $x$ direction, parallel to the walls). The velocity field has only one
component, in the $x$ direction, and varies only with distance from the lower wall $y = 0$.

$$u(y) = U y/H$$

where $U$ is the speed of the upper wall and $H$ is the height of the gap between the walls.
=#

#=
We plot the velocity profile opposite to how we would usually plot a function: with $u$ on
the horizontal axis and $y$ on the vertical axis. Also, it is far preferred to plot this
**nondimensionally**: plot $u/U$ vs $y/H$. This ensures that the plot can be understood more
universally, rather than specific to just one wall speed and one gap height.

In Julia, one useful idea is to define a function with *keyword arguments* that take default
values if we omit them. Here, we will use this to define the velocity function so that it can
behave either dimensionally (by setting $U$ and $H$ explicity) or nondimensionally (by not setting
them, so that $U$ and $H$ each default to 1). By doing the latter, then '$y$' actually represents
$y/H$ and '$u$' represents $u/U$.
=#

u_couette(y;U=1,H=1) = U*y/H

#=
Now generate a set of points in $y$ (between 0 and 1), evaluate $u$, and plot the profile:
=#
y = 0:0.01:1
plot(u_couette.(y),y,xlims=(0,1),ylims=(0,1),xguide="u/U",yguide="y/H",framestyle=:box,title="Couette flow profile")

#=
It should be understood that this profile signifies that the flow is going horizontally,
remains at rest at the bottom $y=0$, and is fastest at the top $y = H$.
=#

# A channel Poiseuille flow profile would be parabolic:
u_pois(y;U=1,H=1) = 4*U*y*(H-y)/H^2
#-
plot(u_pois.(y),y,xlims=(0,1),ylims=(0,1),xguide="u/U",yguide="y/H",framestyle=:box,title="Poiseuille flow profile")

#=
### Other ways we visualize a flow
The velocity profile is only one way to understand a flow, and it only is helpful
in certain circumstances, such as near a wall. For more complex flows, we need some additional
tools to visualize a flow.
=#

#=
We will use the flow from the same pre-computed CFD solution we used in the previous notebook.
This is the steady state flow past a NACA 4415 airfoil at 5 degrees angle of attack at Reynolds
number 500.
=#
##filename = joinpath(MAE150A.notebook_dir,"NACA4415Re500.jld")
filename = "NACA4415Re500.jld"
u, t, sys = load_ns_solution(filename);

#=
First, let's get the flow fields associated with the flow state: velocity (`vel`),
vorticity (`ω`), streamfunction (`ψ`), and pressure (`press`)
=#
vel = ViscousFlow.velocity(u,sys,t)
ω = ViscousFlow.vorticity(u,sys,t)
ψ = ViscousFlow.streamfunction(u,sys,t)
press = ViscousFlow.pressure(u,sys,t);

# ### Plotting the vorticity field
plot(ω,sys,levels=range(-15,15,length=30), color = :RdBu,clim=(-15,15),ylim=(-1,1),xlim=(-1,3),
      size=(900,300),colorbar=:true,title="Vorticity field")
#=
This is a contour plot. Each line represents a contour of constant value of the
quantity we are plotting. Here, that value is **vorticity**.

Vorticity represents the local rate of rotation in the flow. Because of the no-slip
condition on the surface of the wing, the motion of fluid passing over the wing imparts
a clockwise rotation to the fluid near the wing. This corresponds to negative vorticity.
(Rembember the "right-hand rule".) Similarly, fluid motion under the wing imparts
counter-clockwise rotation, or positive vorticity.

These regions of vorticity are called *boundary layers*. We will discuss them
extensively later in the term. There are three key things to observe about them here:
* The boundary layer on the upper surface is actually **separating** from the wing.
  This is an indication of stall! Stall, as you probably know, is not good for flight.
* Behind the wing is the **wake**. The wake is actually quite large in this case
because of the separated flow. In aerodynamics we generally desire attached flow and
a narrow wake.
* Outside of the boundary layers, the flow is entirely **irrotational**. There
is fluid motion out there, but no rotational motion in that flow.
=#


#=
### Plot the streamfunction field
In this case, we also will create a line contour plot, but use the same color for each
contour. Why do we do this? Maybe you have a guess once you look at it.
=#
plot(ψ,sys,levels=31, color = :Black, xlim = (-1,3),ylim=(-0.5,0.5),size=(900,400),title="Streamfunction field")

#=
These lines of constant streamfunction are **streamlines**. You can see the separated
flow region quite clearly as the region with "missing" streamlines on the upper surface.
=#

#=
### Plot the velocity field components
This is a vector field, so we will plot the components separately.
=#
plot(
    plot(vel.u,sys,size=(900,300),levels=range(-0.1,1.5,length=31), color = :RdBu,clim=(-0.1,1.5),xlim=(-1,3),ylim=(-0.5,0.5),title="x component of velocity"),
    plot(vel.v,sys,size=(900,300),color=:RdBu,levels=range(-0.15,0.15,length=31),clim=(-0.15,0.15),xlim=(-1,3),ylim=(-0.5,0.5),title="y component of velocity"),
    layout=(2,1),
    size=(800,400)
    )
#=
There is not as much important to say about these components. It is not very
typical to plot individual components like this, and it is challenging to interpret
these plots.
=#

#=
### Plot the magnitude of the velocity field
This field is the speed of the flow.
=#
umag = mag(vel)
plot(umag,sys,color = :RdBu, ylim = (-0.5,0.5),xlim = (-1,3),size=(900,400),title="Velocity magnitude field",colorbar=:true)

#=
Notice that the wake is clearly shown in this field, distinctly slower than the rest
of the flow.
=#

#=
### Pressure coefficient field
Now let's plot the pressure coefficient field. The pressure coefficient $C_p$ is just a
normalization of the pressure:

$$C_p = \dfrac{p-p_\infty}{\frac{1}{2} \rho U_\infty^2}$$

In this case, the free stream and density are both equal to 1, so we just divide pressure by
0.5 (i.e., multiply pressure by 2) to get the pressure coefficient.
=#
plot(2*press,sys,levels=range(-1.5,1.5,length=31),color=:RdBu,clim=(-1.5,1.5),xlim=(-1,1),ylim=(-0.5,0.5),
        colorbar=:true,size=(900,400),title="Pressure coefficient")
#=
There are two notable features in the pressure. Along the upper part of the wing,
the pressure is very low. This is the **suction** side of the wing, where it generates
most of its lift. Also, there is a region of higher pressure at the front of the wing
where the flow stagnates.
